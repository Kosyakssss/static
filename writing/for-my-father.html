  <h1>for my father</h1>

  <p>My dear, my lovely father,<br />
    My one, and my forever only.<br />
    With you, though, it’s never lonely,<br />
    The instigator of my pother.</p>
  <p>Your knowledge far, your gaze is wide.<br />
    I know a little, you know so much.<br />
    Or so it seems, to a child such<br />
    As me, your eldest young-eyed.</p>
  <p>It used to be that you walked in,<br />
    I shall tense up, like ’fore a king.<br />
    And as you speak your words would swing,<br />
    As your wise teachings would begin.</p>
  <p>Now something’s changed, I don’t know what.<br />
    Life did its thing, that much is true,<br />
    Made up a widespread topics queue…<br />
    In front of fire we now plot.</p>
  <p>Our late night talks, they mesmerize.<br />
    The drinks mom brought cut time in two,<br />
    And as we speak, I look into<br />
    Your wise and always shining eyes.</p>
  <p>Your smile, oh, that awful smile…<br />
    My ladies see it, and they blush,<br />
    The poorest feeling it will crush!<br />
    I can’t mistake it from a mile.</p>
  <p>And as a father you teach me.<br />
    A thousand books, more movies yet,<br />
    Tired of it, I’ll never get.<br />
    I’m learning all that there can be.</p>
  <p>There is so much I wish to say,<br />
    Ten thousand verses more to write,<br />
    But love’s not easy to describe…<br />
    Oh, all that I cannot portray!</p>
  <p>So, being just as you concise,<br />
    I’m living to the full extent,<br />
    Trying to be a worthy friend<br />
    To you. I hope it will suffice.</p>
  <p>My dear, my lovely father,<br />
    I infinitely love you whole.<br />
    Forever grateful for your role<br />
    In giving me what’s now my bother.</p>
