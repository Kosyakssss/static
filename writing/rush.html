  <h1>rush</h1>


  <p>What is this life we rush forth through,<br />
    Where we can’t stop to notice true?</p>
  <p>But we must run, as we have done,<br />
    For years go, and years come.</p>
  <p>And so we run in search of blunt,<br />
    Too occupied, like on a hunt:</p>
  <p>Our skies are crushed by buildings tall —<br />
    Created by and for us all.</p>
  <p>But as we go close to the sky,<br />
    Our grass goes orange, flat, and dry.</p>
  <p>As one expects, the day is tight;<br />
    Their clock again will strike midnight,</p>
  <p>And they will fall into a dream,<br />
    With hope for touch and lips that gleam…</p>
  <p>Another world, so free of rush,<br />
    Where grass is green and tall and lush.</p>
  <p>All of the smells that feel surreal…<br />
    They are jerked back to what is real.</p>
  <p>Tomorrow they will likely stop<br />
    And catch a breath — not on the top —</p>
  <p>But on the grass, the truer one,<br />
    Goodbye, the rush; oh what you’ve done!</p>
  <p>Now that we love around us,<br />
    Who is to stop and join thus?</p>
  <p>Who has the spare time to live<br />
    The shortest moment of belief?</p>
  <p>And even if, someone does halt<br />
    And join our lovers’ vault,</p>
  <p>Where we stand together just to stare,<br />
    To notice life that does not spare…</p>
  <p>And if they love just like we love,<br />
    To stare now and stare true,</p>
  <p>Do we expect to love them too,<br />
    A new bystander of the troop?</p>
  <p>Like a bird will sing to find a mate,<br />
    We stopped to love, and without mistake,</p>
  <p>We see the one who wasn’t late —<br />
    They came in time, and with a cake:</p>
  <p>Just slow enough was their step,<br />
    That we kept up and took a gap.</p>
  <p>For real feel is slow; it simmers,<br />
    Just like the lips, with shiny glimmers —</p>
  <p>The kitchen love with wines and pears,<br />
    And cake of love spread through the years:</p>
  <p>It is so slow, that runners too<br />
    Will always catch that it is true.</p>
  <p>In times of vain, and times of high,<br />
    We will remember the love cry.</p>
