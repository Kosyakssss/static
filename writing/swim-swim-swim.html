  <h1>swim swim swim</h1>


  <h2>Flood</h2>
  <p>It flooded him suddenly. An immense, pressurised wave of emotion,
    story, love, tragedy, joke, opinion, nudge to believe. He forgot what he
    wished to do and fell into the wave. It was vast, infinitely deep, and
    infinitely emotional.</p>
  <p>There was something that was strange about it, however. He didn’t
    feel like he enjoyed it, even though he did. He didn’t feel like he
    wanted to stay underwater, even though he did. He wanted to swim back
    up, but with each stroke the flood of emotion pulled him back in, ever
    deeper, feeding him more desire to stay in every time…</p>
  <p>Just an instant ago he felt fine. Just an instant ago he knew what he
    wished to do. And just an instant later he was wallowing in what he
    could only describe as an emotional mess.</p>
  <p>Another instant later he opens his eyes, not remembering when he
    closed them. He felt sand under his feet, he heard the sea in front of
    him and he saw… Nothing. “It’s all a blur…” he said visibly confused.
    All of what he had felt just a moment ago was still inside, in one big
    mess of a ball. It was disgusting, like he had been forcefully fed a rug
    with which the floors were mopped.</p>
  <p>“Why do I want to go back? I feel like I can no longer see. Is it a
    dream?”</p>
  <p>He waited, then turned around. He was in the kitchen of his
    apartment. The kettle was beginning to boil, small bursts of steam
    coming out of it. The sun was starting to set, warm streaks of light
    coming onto his off-white, tiled walls. His eyes rushed to the clock,
    body making a sudden twitch, like he was stressed for a second in the
    expectation of his finding. Last time he remembered was around 6pm. It
    was now 6:43.</p>
  <p>“How do 40 minutes vanish in an instant, how is the kettle boiling if
    I don’t remember setting it on the stove? Shit, I’m going to be late” he
    thought, almost screaming in his mind while turning the stove off and
    running towards the exit, storming off in confusion to meet a
    friend.</p>

  <h2>Lights</h2>
  <p>He couldn’t sleep anymore. City lights were too bright, city sounds
    were too loud and the pace of it all was way out of his league. The only
    thing that was to his liking was the job.</p>
  <p>Ever since that time he drowned a lot. First it was rare, every
    couple of weeks. Now it was a daily occurence. Sometimes it happened
    twice a day. It was torture. But in the moments like this… He wished to
    drown and fall asleep through the conglomeration of random feelings.</p>
  <p>The moonlight didn’t really hit his apartment windows. It was
    overshadowed by the street lamps, ad postings, and lighting on the wall
    of a nearby skyscraper. Medication doesn’t help, reading doesn’t help,
    people’s advice do not help either. “I just wish for the wave to come
    now”.</p>
  <p>He felt disappointed in himself, wishing for that which he did not
    understand even all these months later. Repetitiveness of his life now
    requested this rag which he despised.</p>

  <h2>The chair</h2>
  <p>Another appointment, this time not with a friend, nor work-related.
    He sat down in a deep, weirdly comforting leather chair. Shelves around
    him still contained the same books, the table in front of him still had
    the same photo frame, small clock, notebooks and pens. And behind the
    table sat the same doctor.</p>
  <p>He didn’t remember what they talked about, only of his childhood.</p>
  <p>“Try to recall moments of your childhood which you liked, which
    brought you joy…”</p>
  <p>As he stood there, waiting for his homemade pizza in the oven, in
    anticipation of his friends coming over, he tried to recall. What was
    good? Was there any good? Not much for sure. The small fights of his
    world, the small fights of others that he participated in. He remembered
    no more than that. It was always fights for something. Except this one
    thing…</p>
  <p>“You got any plans for winter, Craig?” asked George. “Oh damn, this
    pizza smells nice bro!”</p>
  <p>“Thanks,” he said. “No, no plans yet, why are you asking?”</p>
  <p>“Bro…” said Alex after biting off half a slice at once, barely
    finding it possible to speak at all. Though this chewing couldn’t stop
    him. “You said that you liked skiing when you were young, rig…” he
    swallowed the pizza “khm… right?”</p>
  <p>“Yeah”</p>
  <p>“Why don’t we go this season. Neither me nor George have ever skied
    and you make it sound like a perfect trip for the three of us every time
    you talk about it. Let’s go this winter and tear up some slopes.” He
    took another giant bite, finishing off the slice.</p>
  <p>“How the fuck do you eat like this? You got a black hole in your
    mouth or something?” Asked George. Craig wondered the same thing.</p>
  <p>“Yo, when my bro cooks this good I think I might need to marry him
    and not my girl. I don’t know how you don’t eat like this.”</p>
  <p>“You don’t eat, you fucking vacuum these slices up, leave some food
    for us too!”</p>
  <p>Craig calmed them down: “Nah I got another two coming out of the oven
    in 20 minutes, don’t worry you idiots”.</p>
  <p>“Craig?”</p>
  <p>“Yes?”</p>
  <p>“I might be buying a ring for you soon.”</p>
  <p>“Fuck off!”</p>
  <p>A volley of laughter made him feel at ease. He didn’t wish for the
    wave right now. It felt inappropriate to even think about it.</p>
  <p>“So?” Alex apparently didn’t know that he could speak without
    chewing. “You wanna ski this season?”</p>
  <p>“Sure, let’s go.”</p>
  <p>“You’ll have to teach us though.”</p>
  <p>“No problem, you two will take it up easily I think.”</p>
  <p>“You know what else I can…”</p>
  <p>“Shut the fuck up Alex!” George threw an olive at him. “Where are we
    going then?”</p>
  <p>“I know a good place, lemme show you…”</p>

  <h2>Remembrance</h2>
  <p>Ski season started two weeks later. The flight was long, tedious, and
    had two layovers. By the time they got to the hotel his two companions
    immediately went to bed. He wasn’t so eager to do so. For the first time
    in a long while his memories were flooding in, reminding him of what
    good he could recall. Barely anything of his childhood was still stored
    in his brain, but this view was always there.</p>
  <p>He recalled the first time he was here, probably twice as short,
    looking at the same slopes that go so high up you can’t see some of
    them. Mountains that stand in front of him are monumental, being there
    for millions of years, almost never changing. They are so tranquil it
    sometimes feels that they wish to convey a certain truth to one who
    wishes to hear it, to one who accepts the calm, who respects the
    monumentality, who respects the slope.</p>
  <p>He recalled when his dad taught him to stand on the skis for the
    first time, when he still could only go slowly, awkwardly putting the
    noses of the skis together, hopelessly wishing that he could be as good
    as his father one day. He recalled when his dad, on the second or the
    third year of their skiing, put him on a black slope and as he struggled
    to get down without falling went fast to the first time in his life,
    starting to understand that going fast is safer than going slow…</p>
  <p>He recalled that when he turned 17 his dad allowed him to drink
    Mulled wine if he didn’t tell mom. At that time he also finally became
    almost as fast as his dad, which brought him great joy and destroyed the
    mystery of an unachievable standard that was his father.</p>
  <p>Snow stopped, clouds vanished, drifting away, further and further,
    slowly opening up the sky to his view. The light of the crescent moon
    shines bright in the mountains, illuminating his face. Illuminating the
    confusion, even as he realises his childhood, even in the moment of no
    yearning for a flood, he stands there. Motionless physically, faster
    than light in his soul.</p>

  <h2>Thin</h2>
  <p>They took a long break, 2 weeks off work and study to have as much
    time as they can squeeze out of their forcefully busy lives to be here,
    as close to the stars as they can be when nothing separates them from
    their grasp. No metal enclosure holding them back from breathing the
    thin air mountains provide them with, reluctantly accepting new
    visitors, who do not yet fully respect the danger that comes packaged
    with absolute freedom.</p>
  <p>For a week, he trained them, taught them the basics. They were all
    lifelong athletes, thus taking up the training quickly. By the end of
    the week both George and Alex could keep their skis straight to the
    immense surprise of Craig. His struggle to keep them straight lasted for
    several seasons, before he finally gained to speed to keep up with with
    the flow of his surroundings. Yet here his friends were, fearlessly
    taking over others on the slope. Maybe he should have told them more
    about these mountains. Although, he wasn’t told either… He was shown and
    forced to bear witness to his own mistakes.</p>
  <p>They could now all go on longer, steeper slopes, gain more speed,
    bringing the essence of skiing ever closer.</p>
  <p>He now decided that he can leave them behind, knowing that they will
    meet by the lift and repeat until dusk sets in and the space lift
    closes, forcing them closer to the nightly motionless. The last day had
    to be his only.</p>
  <p>Now he stood atop the mountain, still, anticipating the moment. Sun
    was starting to change its colour, sky was becoming pink. And when his
    soul started screaming at the opportunity to slow down he went. Carving
    from one side of the wide edge of the mountain to another he gained
    speed. His skis, just like the mountain air brings him closest to the
    stars, bring him closest to earth, a thin layer of expensive carbon
    separating his body from the skin of a body thousands of times more
    magnificent than his own. With the speed he gained communication. His
    soul was slowing down as he sped up.</p>
  <p>He hunkered down. It was time yet again. Wind whirred by, grains of
    snow raised into the air by people who went down this slope before him
    struck him, his knees were aching, but how could he listen to them. They
    were his vessel to life, if he gave up now he would crash. They had to
    respect the magnificent as much as their master does. And so they kept
    aching, but still held strong. The punishment of every impact they
    absorb and of every direction change they hold together will come later,
    they have to hold it off. Such was their master’s command.</p>
  <p>Suddenly the aching went away.</p>
  <p>“…”</p>
  <p>He knows he is there. His soul is now completely still. His body
    reached the limit of the speed he can gain now while keeping his legs
    planted on the ground. The mountain is no more. The knees will hold him
    on it’s slope, the skis will allow the magnificent to tell him their
    truth once again. Quietness filled him suddenly. No thought was needed,
    nothing extra could fill his mind or heart. He felt the stillness flow
    into him through the skis that were his horse and through the knees that
    were his saddle. They followed command of their king, who now acted only
    according to his instinct. He had to listen.</p>
  <p>This flow started to dwindle as soon he saw the bottom of the
    mountain. He was forced to slow down, as per the instinct he chose to
    guide him. He didn’t wish for more. He didn’t wish for another
    conquering. When the flow finally stopped he slid down the hill, his
    soul slowly regaining it’s speed. There they were, his forever favourite
    idiots, stopping another one of their fights to notice him.</p>

  <h2>Death and cherries</h2>
  <p>The trip came and went. The trio returned each to their homes. He was
    in the city again, wondering how his soul never regained it’s
    overpowering speed. The height of the skyscrapers dawned on him again,
    as if they were really scraping the roof of this world, its pieces
    falling on him every time he ventured outside.</p>
  <p>Now, sitting at a bar, drinking a negroni, he looked outside.</p>
  <p>“Rain…”</p>
  <p>He turned his head. Another was sitting there, one seat from him in
    this empty bar. He didn’t notice him entering or ordering the same drink
    as him.</p>
  <p>“Yeah… It’s been like this for a week now.”</p>
  <p>“How do you feel about it?” said the stranger, only partly addressing
    Craig, partly just blurting the sentence into the world. It seemed to
    not be a question at all. He kept going before getting an answer, a pick
    with a cherry on it whirling around in his fingers.</p>
  <p>“I enjoy the rain. It forces this city to slow down. People are
    together more, joining each other truly in their spaces, not just
    meeting friends outside. It forces us to create warmth to keep one
    another comfortable in this weather. All as it should be. It slows
    everything down to a constant speed, the speed at which we are not
    overwhelmed. It doesn’t need to be faster at all.”</p>
  <p>The dark red berry disappeared into the speakers mouth, and he
    himself disappeared from the space.</p>
  <p>He was in the kitchen of his apartment. The kettle was beginning to
    boil, small bursts of steam coming out of it. The sun was starting to
    set, warm streaks of light coming through the rare opening in the
    clouds, his off-white, tiled walls are illuminated by a lamp on the
    table. He poured himself tea and opened a book his late grandfather gave
    him.</p>
  <p>The mountains told the truth after all.</p>
