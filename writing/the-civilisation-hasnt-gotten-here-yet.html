  <h1>the civilisation hasnt gotten here yet</h1>


  <h2>Liberty</h2>
  <p>The right to see…</p>
  <p>To see the small pieces of the puzzle of nature that is around us. To
    not be interrupted by anything other than the other puzzle pieces.</p>
  <p>To breathe the air that makes you feel tranquil. Be it mountains or
    the forest or the sea… or maybe even the desert. You not only see them,
    you breathe them.</p>
  <p>To hear every little movement around you, millions of minuscule
    particles of sand interacting with one another, leaves flailing around
    in the air, animals from big to almost invisible performing their own
    routines.</p>
  <p>And to combine all three of these feelings and others into one
    perfect symphony of constantly meditating nature, that is beautiful even
    when it’s scary.</p>

  <h2>The music</h2>
  <p>Life in a big city, where the hours of tranquil nature are replaced
    with seconds of human interactions weighed by a burden of hurry and lack
    of time. Development is revolutionary, because the 5-6 free hours one
    has in a given day are limited.</p>
  <p>The sheer numbers of people to see… meetings with friends become
    similar to appointments, no different from going to the dentist.</p>
  <p>Connections are viewed as beneficial opportunities, not as a natural
    reality of discovering another alive soul.</p>
  <p>Here the only alive thing is music, performed at a jazz or a blues
    bar somewhere in a basement. All the players are like the wind, the
    leaves, the grass and the trees…</p>
  <p>They play not music for a corporation, but a sound interpretation of
    souls intertwining, connecting and creating a new feeling.</p>
  <p>Their mistakes are natural and beautiful, their eyes interlock and
    every time that happens it feels like a new star has been born. Tempo
    intensifies, reaching the peak…</p>
  <p>When suddenly everyone but the drummer stops playing. Everyone is
    focused on him. The conversations get quiet. He starts slow and quiet,
    his solo pulling the strings of attention of even the busy bartender
    crafting another Negroni.</p>
  <p>The drummer is looking everywhere and nowhere at the same time. His
    eyes see the sounds that he is yet to have created. As he is about to
    reach the peak as he looks at the other band members…</p>
  <p>They look at him…</p>
  <p>A star is born…</p>
  <p>As he reaches the peak a bass and a piano enter the show once again
    and it all slows down again. It is truly alike to observing the nature
    of this world.</p>

  <h2>A man in a hurry</h2>
  <p>He walks into the basement. His eyes are obviously focused on the
    remnants of an ending day, the troubles he was brought. He is dressed
    well, but his posture became frail after such a busy day.</p>
  <p>After a second of realising where he is he waddles over to the bar.
    His order is something that he himself wouldn’t remember. And does it
    really matter what he is going to drink? He looks emptily at the
    bartender shaking the drink before pouring it into a glass for him.</p>
  <p>He takes a gulp. The alcohol burns his tongue, then throat, then his
    insides. He licks his dried lips and they burn too.</p>
  <p>“Hm”</p>
  <p>He takes a deep breath and looks at the band. Now is not the time
    yet… Now is not the time.</p>
  <p>He takes a sip, takes a deep breath. Suddenly he is no longer at a
    bar. The band playing in the corner pulled his strings. He takes a seat
    on the couch, the drink still in his hand.</p>
  <p>The only light that hits him is a small red lamp above him. But the
    simple, beautiful love of the band playing in the corner… Maybe now is
    the time. Maybe now he is in the nature, maybe now he feels it. But
    Monday will come for him either way.</p>

  <h2>A tailor</h2>
  <p>Sunlight hits his eyes in the morning. Two hours later it hits the
    insides of his shop in the middle of a small town. As he brews his
    morning coffee he looks over at the door right as his good customer
    enters. He is a rich Londoner, who comes to this small Italian tailor
    once every three months.</p>
  <p>They drink coffee. They talk for hours. Two old men. Grey hair. Both
    dressed well. While they are in this small town, they are free.</p>
  <p>They need no phones, they need no schedule…</p>
  <p>A tailor’s young apprentice walks in. He makes his coffee too while
    the tailor introduces him to the customer.</p>
  <p>They take his measurement, his order, talk for half an hour more and
    the customer leaves. Several more will come by today. They all will talk
    for hours. They all are free while they are in this small town. They all
    hope that the civilisation never reaches here.</p>
