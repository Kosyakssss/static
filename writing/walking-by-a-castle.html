  <h1>walking by a castle</h1>


  <p>“It is interesting” — he thought.</p>
  <p>“Every time I walk by this castle, I feel it’s grandiose. I hear
    what’s happening inside. The remote laughs, the fun, the leisure. Every
    time I get home and sit outside, I can see it through the trees of my
    small garden. When I brew my coffee, I can see it through the window
    from afar. As I walk towards my shop, it gets bigger and bigger by the
    minute. It’s overwhelming. When I talk to townsfolk, they all want be in
    that castle. They see it every day. No matter the riches they have, they
    all aspire to be richer still to get inside.”</p>
  <p>He kept walking by the castle’s wall. Dirty wet bricks shined, still
    wet from the rain.</p>
  <p>“Someone built it. Those weren’t the people inside the castle. They
    aren’t even the ones that commissioned it. They are not the ones that
    appreciate what they have. They just were born in it or got lucky enough
    to get in. None of the townsfolk will ever get in.”</p>
  <p>The gates we incredible. They were giant, probably the height of 10
    people. Yet when they opened, they opened with such ease, almost as if a
    god’s hand was releasing the locks and pushing the massive stone doors
    apart. This made the people of the town feel like there is a way to get
    inside. That they needed to stay outside no longer. That life inside was
    going to be so much better.</p>
  <p>The doors started opening. There were carriages coming both in and
    out.</p>
  <p>He looked at the people in those carriages. They were dressed
    prestigiously, but not too different from the rich people of the town.
    He knew a good tailor who loved telling him about his craft when they
    drank. Sometimes it would get annoying, but at least he now had the
    knowledge of one of the best tailors in the region. He knew that
    difference between the well-off and these people were the minute details
    of their attire. Nothing more.</p>
  <p>Then he noticed the faces. Both incoming and outgoing wore the same
    expressions as the people he saw daily.</p>
  <p>“They truly are no different from the rest of us. They are just lucky
    to be inside. From what I’ve heard, it’s not even that much different
    inside. If anything, they are confined to the space of the castle in
    their day-to-day lives.”</p>
  <p>Just as the sun started setting he reached his house. It stood in
    tranquility on a his, just far enough from the castle and the town to
    easily reach it on foot, but not hear the sounds of the town from the
    garden.</p>
  <p>He caught his son and his daughter as they were running away from his
    wife. Seconds later she ran out from the other room. He started
    laughing. She was fury incarnate, holding her heavy slipper in her hand,
    steam coming out of her ears and the eyes were ready to kill. But seeing
    him changed something. He chased the kids off to bed and got wine from
    the cellar, she brought dinner to the table outside. They ate and
    talked.</p>
  <p>She knew how it was in the castle. Yet she lived here happily, in a
    tranquil house on a hill, venturing off to the town every morning with
    her husband. Neither of them dreamed of the castle life, yet both were
    the only ones who wore a different expression on their faces.</p>
  <p>No, they weren’t lacking the dreams. They weren’t lacking the riches.
    Quite the opposite. They just didn’t dream of the castle. Seemingly,
    they were the only ones who knew how to dream differently.</p>
