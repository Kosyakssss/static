            Hi, I'm Kote. Here you will see some of my writing that I always
            one-shoot, and maybe some pent up thoughts about tech and life.
            Enjoy.
        </p>

        <h2>thoughts</h2>

        <ol type="i" reversed>
            <li>asdf</li>
            <li>asdf</li>
            <li>asdf</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>writing</h2>

        <h3>asdf</h3>
        <p>
            I am not a coder, and this website is the first thing I've ever
            written by myself (also using minimal ai). It is based on the
            Flexoki theme, and is writen using almost no js
        </p>
