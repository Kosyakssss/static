## He walks into his greenhouse

He checks on the plants inside. He checks for bugs. He checks the moisture of the soil. He checks the dust on the leaves.

When no one is around… he hums to them.

The memories of old flood his mind. And his plants seemingly start singing too. Singing their quiet song to their lonely owner.

He sits down by the wall. There is a book on the small wooden table near him. He falls asleep before recalling what book it was. He falls asleep to the lovely quiet song of the plants. The plants that sing to their lonely owner.

## They were just like the stars…

They were laying on the grass, looking at the clear night sky. Warm wind was calmly drifting over the mountainside, sometimes making her hair rise up with a gust and fall on her face. Every time this put a smile on his face.

His car was parked up the hill, away from the main road. They threw their shoes into the backseat to enjoy this late spring grass.

City lights flickered far away as some went to sleep and some just got home. One could barely see them through the opening between two mountains standing between the city and him.

He looked at her. A small, barely noticeable smile war on her face. Stars glistened in her beautiful eyes.

“No matter what I do, I will never truly know what she is thinking. How pitiful is that.” — he thought. But he knew one thing. She lays there beside him. She knows his shame. And she loves him for it.

“That’s all I need to know.” — he decided. He knew her shame too. From the first night they spent together. And he loves her for it.

He extends his hand, letting her palm lay on his. She squeezed it.

At this moment his head was finally empty and his soul fount its rest.

Maybe tomorrow will be different. Maybe the years will change them. But he knows he will remember this moment forever. He would recall this feeling. He would fight to not let it go.

At least he hopes so.

## Flight

Activation of the main engine hydrogen burnoff system. Main engine start. Liftoff.

There is only one passenger. A stray from Moscow streets.

The flight didn’t go as planned. The cabin slowly started heating up.

Layka’s heart started racing. More than expected.

The last words she probably heard were of a single worried scientist over a simple soviet radio… They knew she wasn’t coming back. But they didn’t expect this to happen.

“Please forgive us, Layka.”

## Warmth

The spring was bursting from its seems. Small warm drizzles, warm sun after, birds sign once again, couples laugh and visit cafes, dressing lighter by the day. Sometimes the drizzle would come at just the right time, when they decide to wear light cloth shoes…

This was the day.

Night radiated a different energy…

As she walked into the backyard of a speakeasy the smells and sounds penetrated her senses…

A smell of sweet tobacco, mixed with spilled alcohol, fruits and newly blooming cherry tree in the middle of the yard…

She saw her man sitting at the corner table with his friends and their wives surrounding him. Their loud laughs and smiles oozed of quiet souls being entangled in the freeing air of spring.

As she walked towards the table he saw her. It was dark, but she could see his eyes light up ever more the closer she approached.

He jumped up, leaving the cigarette he lit up seconds ago burning in the ashtray. They kiss as if they didn’t see each other for years… it’s only been a couple of hours.

They embraced each other in a hopeful hug.

By the time they sat down his cigarette turned to ash. The laughter continued through until the darkest depth of the night.
