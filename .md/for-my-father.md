My dear, my lovely father,  
My one, and my forever only.  
With you, though, it’s never lonely,  
The instigator of my pother.  
  
Your knowledge far, your gaze is wide.  
I know a little, you know so much.  
Or so it seems, to a child such  
As me, your eldest young-eyed.  
  
It used to be that you walked in,  
I shall tense up, like 'fore a king.  
And as you speak your words would swing,  
As your wise teachings would begin.  
  
Now something’s changed, I don't know what.  
Life did its thing, that much is true,  
Made up a widespread topics queue…  
In front of fire we now plot.  
  
Our late night talks, they mesmerize.  
The drinks mom brought cut time in two,  
And as we speak, I look into  
Your wise and always shining eyes.  
  
Your smile, oh, that awful smile…  
My ladies see it, and they blush,  
The poorest feeling it will crush!  
I can't mistake it from a mile.  
  
And as a father you teach me.  
A thousand books, more movies yet,  
Tired of it, I’ll never get.  
I’m learning all that there can be.  
  
There is so much I wish to say,  
Ten thousand verses more to write,  
But love's not easy to describe…  
Oh, all that I cannot portray!  
  
So, being just as you concise,  
I’m living to the full extent,  
Trying to be a worthy friend  
To you. I hope it will suffice.  
  
My dear, my lovely father,  
I infinitely love you whole.  
Forever grateful for your role  
In giving me what's now my bother.
